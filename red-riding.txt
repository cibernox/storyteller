Once upon a time there was a dear little girl
who was loved by everyone who looked at her,
but most of all by her grandmother,
and there was nothing that she would not have
given to the child. Once she gave her a little
riding hood of red velvet, which suited her so
well that she would never wear anything else;
so she was always called 'Little Red Riding Hood.

One day her mother said to her:
'Come, Little Red Riding Hood, here is a piece
of cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your
grandmother, she is ill and weak, and they will
do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and when
you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not
run off the path, or you may fall and break the
bottle, and then your grandmother will get nothing;
and when you go into her room, don't forget to say,
"Good morning", and don't peep into every corner
before you do it.

'I will take great care,'
said Little Red Riding Hood to her mother, and gave her hand on it.

The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league
from the village, and just as Little Red Riding Hood
entered the wood, a wolf met her.
Red Riding Hood did not know what a wicked creature
he was, and was not at all afraid of him.
