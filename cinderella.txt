Once upon a time... there lived an unhappy young girl.
Unhappy she was, for her mother was dead, her father
had married another woman, a widow with two daughters,
and her stepmother didn't like her one little bit. All
the nice things, kind thoughts and loving touches were
for her own daughters. And not just the kind thoughts
and love, but also dresses, shoes, shawls, delicious
food, comfy beds, as well as every home comfort. All
this was laid on for her daughters. But, for the poor
unhappy girl, there was nothing at all. No dresses,
only her stepsisters' hand-me-downs. No lovely dishes,
nothing but scraps. No nice rests and comfort. For she
had to work hard all day, and only when evening came was
she allowed to sit for a while by the fire, near the cinders.
That is how she got her nickname, for everybody called her
Cinderella. Cinderella used to spend long hours all alonetalking
to the cat. The cat said,
"Miaow", which really meant, "Cheer up! You have something
neither of your stepsisters have and that is beauty."

It was quite true. Cinderella, even dressed in rags with
a dusty grey face from the cinders, was a lovely girl.
While her stepsisters, no matter how splendid and elegant
their clothes, were still clumsy, lumpy and ugly and always would be.

One day, beautiful new dresses arrived at the house.
A ball was to be held at Court and the stepsisters were getting
ready to go to it. Cinderella, didn't even dare ask,
"What about me?" for she knew very well what the answer
to that would be:

"You? My dear girl, you're staying at home to wash the dishes,
scrub the floors and turn down the beds for your stepsisters.
They will come home tired and very sleepy."

Cinderella sighed at the cat:
"oh dear, I'm so unhappy!" and the cat murmured "Miaow".
